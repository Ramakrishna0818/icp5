When comparing Naive Bayes and plain SVM, Naive Bayes outperformed SVM in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This was primarily because the data had six classifiers and wasn't transformed into a higher dimension, making it difficult for SVM to produce superior results. SVM could potentially have performed better if the data had been transformed using the kernel option. In summary, when faced with the choice between Naive Bayes and plain SVM, opting for Naive Bayes would be the preferable decision.
